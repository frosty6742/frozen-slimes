Hi everyone, this is a slime vr project to create slime cases that are simular in design to the offical cases. This project will currently be using a wemo d1 mini, mpu6050, and a TP4056 charger. On my personal slimes I use 18650 batteries and wanted a case that can fit these with out being massive.
