# Frozen Slimes 

## Hi everyone, this is a slime vr project to create slime cases that are simular in design to the official cases but fit all the diy components. 

### contact: lynxo#7417

This project will currently be using a Wemo D1 mini, mpu6050, and a TP4056 charger. On my personal slimes I use 18650 batteries and wanted a case that can fit these with out being massive. [Offical Component Guide](https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/components-guide.html)

### Case

Curently working on a fusion file, waiting for the tottal height of the pcb and components so I can keep the case as compact as possible

Stls and Fs3d files will be avilable soon!


### PCB 
*this has not been tested yet, mine are currently ordered and in the mail*

The gerber file for this is labled ``` frozen slime gerber file v1 ```

Top left pads are for battery

Switch pads are for switch, wiring direction does not matter

Final four pads are for soldering an extension


### Printing 

Printing instructions for how you want to build your slimes will be added here

### Assembly 

Assembly instructions will be added here in the future
