# Frozen Slimes 

## Hi everyone, this is a slime vr project to create slime cases that are simular in design to the offical cases. 

### contact: lynxo#7417

This project will currently be using a Wemo D1 mini, mpu6050, and a TP4056 charger. On my personal slimes I use 18650 batteries and wanted a case that can fit these with out being massive. Offical [Offical Component Guide](https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/components-guide.html)

For the Hyperion you will need the following components:

- [TP4056](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32649780468.html)
- [Wemos D1 Mini](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=D1+mini)
- [40mm straps](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002350231996.html)
- [IMU](https://docs.slimevr.dev/components-guide.html) (*BNO08x chips are currently in a pretty bad shortage*)
    - [MPU6050](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=MPU6050)  
- [Switch](https://docs.slimevr.dev/components-guide.html) (*SS22F32 is what the docs suggest, SS12D00G3 is smaller and looks better for this case*)
    - [SS12D00G3](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=SS12D00G3)
    - [SS22F32](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32975535599.html)
- [Battery](https://docs.slimevr.dev/components-guide.html) (*804040 is what the docs suggest, 503759 is smaller and usually higher capacity*)

The gerber file for this is labled ``` frozen slime gerber file v1 ```

Top left pads are for battery

Switch pads are for switch, wiring direction does not matter

Final four pads are for soldering an extension
