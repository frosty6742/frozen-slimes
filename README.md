# Frozen Slimes 

## Hi everyone, this is a slime vr project to create slime cases that are simular in design to the offical cases. 

### contact: lynxo#7417

This project will currently be using a Wemo D1 mini, mpu6050, and a TP4056 charger. On my personal slimes I use 18650 batteries and wanted a case that can fit these with out being massive. Offical [Offical Component Guide](https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/components-guide.html)
